# Session Handoff — Current State

**Date**: 2026-04-20
**Last action**: Vault credential injection chain verified. Full flow: Keycloak JWT (with `sub` + `preferred_username` claims) → Vault JWT auth (token exchange) → per-user secret read (policy-templated by `preferred_username`). GitHub MCP server demo preparation in progress.

## Current State Summary

Kind cluster work (Phases 1-18) is preserved on the `advanced` branch. Main branch is focused on OpenShift AI integration — building the end-to-end flow: **Playground UI → Llama Stack → MCP Gateway → MCP Servers**.

Cluster: `agentic-mcp.jolf.p3.openshiftapps.com` (ROSA, OpenShift 4.21.6, RHOAI 3.4.0-ea.2)

### What was completed (April 15 session)

1. **Repo reorganization** — Committed Phase 18 housekeeping, created `advanced` branch (pushed to remote). Moved Kind infra to `infrastructure/kind/`, created `infrastructure/openshift-ai/` for new work.

2. **Cluster assessment** — Catalogued existing deployments: RHOAI 3.4-ea.2, Gen AI Studio enabled, Gateway API CRDs, vLLM 20B+120B in gpt-oss, Llama Stack v6 instances, 3 GPU nodes (4x L40S, 1x L40S, 1x L4).

3. **Baseline documentation** — Created `docs/openshift-ai-prerequisites.md` and 7 YAMLs in `infrastructure/openshift-ai/` covering the full stack from operator subscription to Llama Stack distribution.

4. **vLLM tool calling enabled** — Discovered model uses `openai` parser (not hermes). Patched ServingRuntime and Deployment directly (ServingRuntime patches don't propagate in RawDeployment mode). Scaled 0→1 to avoid GPU deadlock. Verified: `tool_calls` array populated, `finish_reason: "tool_calls"`.

5. **Llama Stack deployed in test-jd** — ConfigMap with remote::vllm inference + inline::rag-runtime tool_runtime (required by agents despite API being deprecated). Created route manually (`exposeRoute: true` didn't work). Responses API verified end-to-end with tool calling.

6. **Playground UI activated** — Discovered undocumented `opendatahub.io/genai-asset: "true"` label (found by grepping dashboard JS). KServe webhook bug rejected all label patches — had to delete/recreate InferenceService. "Create playground" button now appears.

7. **Playground created but blocked** — Playground creates its own Llama Stack pod. Model name mismatch: playground registers model as `vllm-20b` (InferenceService name) but vLLM serves as `gpt-oss-20b` (`--served-model-name`). `provider_model_id` ConfigMap fix did not resolve it.

### What was completed (April 15-16, between sessions)

8. **MCP Gateway v0.5.1 deployed in test-jd** (superseded) — Manual deployment of kagenti MCP Gateway with `data-science-gateway-class`. Worked but had routing issues (no OpenShift Route, exposed via raw AWS ELB only).

### What was completed (April 20 session)

22. **MCP catalog extended** — Added `test-server-2` to the MCP catalog via `mcp-catalog-sources` ConfigMap in `odh-model-registries`. Uses two-key format: `sources.yaml` (index) + `custom-mcp-servers.yaml` (catalog data with `type: yaml` and `yamlCatalogPath`).

23. **test-server-2 deployed** — MCPServer CR with `config.env` for servers that use env vars instead of CLI flags (`MCP_TRANSPORT=http`, `PORT=9090`). Registered with gateway via HTTPRoute + MCPServerRegistration (`test2_` prefix). Gateway now serves 26 tools total (14 openshift + 5 test + 7 test2).

24. **VirtualMCPServers updated** — Admin VirtualMCPServer: 26 tools. User VirtualMCPServer: 12 tools (test + test2 only).

25. **Authorization header stripping** — Added `response.success.headers.authorization: {plain: {value: ""}}` to per-server AuthPolicies. Required because Playground→Llama Stack→MCP Gateway sends the JWT to the upstream MCP server, which rejects it ("cluster requires authentication"). Stripping after Authorino validation fixes the flow.

26. **Keycloak JWT claims fixed** — Added `sub` (via `oidc-sub-mapper`) and `preferred_username` (via `oidc-usermodel-attribute-mapper`) protocol mappers to `mcp-playground` client. Required for Vault per-user secret paths.

27. **Vault deployed and configured** — Vault (Helm) in `openshift-operators`, initialized (non-dev mode, file storage). JWT auth enabled with Keycloak JWKS. KV v2 at `mcp/`. Role `mcp-user` with `claim_mappings` for `sub` and `preferred_username`. Policy `mcp-user-secrets` templates path by `{{identity.entity.aliases.auth_jwt_a4ae6a1f.metadata.preferred_username}}`.

28. **Vault credential injection verified** — Full chain: Keycloak JWT → `vault write auth/jwt/login` → Vault token with user metadata → `vault read mcp/data/users/mcp-admin1/github` → `ghp_PLACEHOLDER_REPLACE_WITH_REAL_PAT`. Policy correctly scopes each user to their own secret path.

### What was completed (April 17 session)

9. **Investigated OpenShift routing gap** — Discovered `data-science-gateway-class` uses Istio which defaults to LoadBalancer. The platform `data-science-gateway` in `openshift-ingress` uses a ConfigMap (`infrastructure.parametersRef`) to force ClusterIP, managed by the RHOAI `GatewayConfig` CR — a platform-level singleton, not available for user namespaces.

10. **Found upstream OpenShift install path** — `github.com/Kuadrant/mcp-gateway/config/openshift/` contains `deploy_openshift.sh` + Helm charts that handle OpenShift-specific setup: `openshift-default` GatewayClass + `mcp-gateway-ingress` chart for Route creation.

11. **MCP Gateway v0.6.0 installed via OLM** — CatalogSource in `openshift-marketplace`, Subscription in `mcp-system`. Controller runs cluster-wide. CRDs upgraded from `mcp.kagenti.com` (v0.5.1) to `mcp.kuadrant.io` (v0.6.0).

12. **`openshift-default` GatewayClass created** — Same `openshift.io/gateway-controller/v1` controller; on this cluster with Service Mesh, it's handled by Istio (creates Envoy proxy), so EnvoyFilter/ext_proc works. On clusters without Service Mesh, this would use HAProxy and ext_proc would not work.

13. **MCP Gateway instance deployed in `mcp-upstream-test`** — Via `oci://ghcr.io/kuadrant/charts/mcp-gateway` (v0.6.0) Helm chart. OpenShift Route created via `mcp-gateway-ingress` chart. End-to-end verified: initialize → tools/list (5 tools) → tools/call (`"Hi OpenShift"`).

14. **test-jd namespace deleted** — Old v0.5.1 setup replaced by `mcp-upstream-test`.

15. **End-to-end flow completed** — Created `gen-ai-aa-mcp-servers` ConfigMap in `redhat-ods-applications` pointing to the MCP Gateway. Playground UI immediately showed it as available. The dashboard automatically wires the ConfigMap URL to Llama Stack's `remote::model-context-protocol` tool_runtime provider — no Llama Stack config changes needed. Tool calling verified through the full chain: Playground → Llama Stack (0.6.0.1+rhai0) → MCP Gateway (v0.6.0) → Test MCP Server.

16. **Keycloak (RHBK) deployed** — RHBK operator v26.4.11 via OLM in `keycloak` namespace. Postgres with gp3-csi PVC. Keycloak instance at `https://keycloak.apps.rosa.agentic-mcp.jolf.p3.openshiftapps.com`. Realm `mcp-gateway` with 2 clients (`mcp-gateway` confidential, `mcp-playground` public), 2 roles (`mcp-user`, `mcp-admin`), 2 users (`mcp-user1`, `mcp-admin1`).

17. **Kuadrant CR deployed** — Created in `openshift-operators`. Authorino (JWT validation) and Limitador (rate limiting) running.

18. **Gateway-level AuthPolicy** — JWT validation on the `mcp` listener. All requests require a valid JWT from the Keycloak `mcp-gateway` realm. Unauthenticated → 401.

19. **OpenShift MCP server deployed** — `openshift-mcp-server` in `mcp-upstream-test`. Read-only, `core` + `config` toolsets, `view` ClusterRole. 14 tools registered with `openshift_` prefix. Gateway now serves 19 tools total (14 openshift + 5 test).

20. **Per-server authorization** — HTTPRoute-level AuthPolicy requires `mcp-admin` role for OpenShift MCP server. `mcp-admin1` gets full access, `mcp-user1` is blocked from OpenShift tools but can use test tools.

21. **Playground auth verified** — Playground UI has a token input field for MCP server auth. With `mcp-admin1` token: full end-to-end working (Playground → Llama Stack → MCP Gateway → OpenShift MCP Server → Kubernetes API). Successfully queried live cluster state through the Playground.

## Known Issues (ongoing)

### OpenShift AI

1. **Playground model name mismatch** — Playground registers model as `vllm-20b` (InferenceService name) but vLLM serves as `gpt-oss-20b` (`--served-model-name`). `provider_model_id` ConfigMap fix didn't resolve it.
2. **KServe webhook bug** — Rejects any InferenceService update (even label patches) with "deploymentMode cannot be changed" error. Workaround: delete and recreate the CR.
3. **ServingRuntime changes don't propagate** — In KServe RawDeployment mode, patching the ServingRuntime doesn't update the Deployment. Must patch the Deployment directly.
4. **GPU deadlock on rollout** — RollingUpdate strategy + single GPU = new pod can't schedule. Scale to 0 first, then back to 1.
5. **tool_runtime still required** — Llama Stack 0.6.1 agents provider has hard dependency on tool_runtime even though API is deprecated.
6. **LlamaStackDistribution route not created** — `exposeRoute: true` didn't work. Manual `oc create route edge` needed.
7. **genai-asset label undocumented** — `opendatahub.io/genai-asset: "true"` required for Playground visibility, not in docs.

### MCP Gateway Auth

8. **`tools/list` ignores authorization** — Broker serves tool list from cache, does not filter by user identity/roles. All 19 tools visible to all authenticated users regardless of per-server AuthPolicies.
9. **Per-server auth failures return "network error"** — When HTTPRoute-level AuthPolicy blocks a `tools/call` (Authorino 403), broker misinterprets as transport error ("likely a legacy SSE server"), returns EOF. Playground shows generic "network error" instead of "access denied."
10. **`mcpCatalog` feature flag missing** — Not in OdhDashboardConfig CRD schema for RHOAI 3.4.0-ea.2. Requires newer build.
11. **Keycloak token lifetime too short** — Default 5-minute access token TTL makes manual Playground testing cumbersome.
12. **Broker logs noisy "tool id is missing" warnings** — OpenShift MCP server tools lack `_meta.id` fields. Doesn't block registration but produces repeated log noise.
